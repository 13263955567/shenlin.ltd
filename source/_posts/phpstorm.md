PHPStorm EAP（Early Access Program）

    JetBrains认为为开发人员制作工具就应该倾听开发人员的心声，让开发人员从最初阶段就参与讨论和影响产品的开发计划，EAP 允许开发人员试用和评估 PHPStorm 下个版本会增加的特性，稳定性有时不如普通的beta版
    
What is Early Access Program?

We at JetBrains believe that making tools for developers should greatly involve listening to developers. Our Early Access Program lets development community closely participate in discussions and influence product development planning, from early stages onwards.

Early Access Program allows you to try pre-release versions of our software to evaluate features that will be added in the next release.

Be warned:  It is important to distinguish EAP from traditional pre-release software. Please note that the quality of EAP versions may at times be way below even usual beta standards. If you are looking for a stable version of PhpStorm, please, visit our site.
