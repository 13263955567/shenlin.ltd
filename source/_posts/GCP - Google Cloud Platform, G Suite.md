On-Prem  ---> Cloud

Cloud is just a set of tools that helps you, the developer, spend less time
managing and more time being created as a developer.

## GCP & G Suite

GCP(Google Cloud Platform) : infrastructure, platform

G Suite : Google Docs, Google Drive...the software as a service

Cloud: infrastructure, platform, software as a service

    IaaS : Infrastructure as a Service
    PaaS : Platform as a Service
    SaaS : Software as a Service

Good Cloud 是 GCP 和 G Suite 的混合体。

## The History of GCP

2012 年时的 GCP 组成：
* Compute Enginee
* App Enginee
* Cloud Storage
* Big Query

目前的 GCP 组成, More than 60 GCP Services：
* Compute
  * Compute Enginee
  * App Enginee
  * ......
  * ......
* Storage and Database
  * Cloud Storage
  * ......
  * ......
* Networking
  * ......
  * ......
* Big Data
  * Big Query
  * ......
  * ......
* Machine Learning
  * ......
  * ......
* Identity & Security
  * ......
  * ......
* Management Tools
  * ......
  * ......
* Developers Tools
  * ......
  * ......

Paradox of choice: less is more, too much choice is stressful

So Focus On Four Areas:
* Compute
  * Virtual Machines
  * Containers
  * Serverless (deploy your codes and let someone else manage that for you)
* Storage and Databases
* Machine Learning
* Big Data

## Kubernetes

Containers Alone Are Not Enough:

If you have a complex application, with a bunch of front-end servers, a bunch of
back-end database servers, some middleware, it's complicated to get all that
stuff to work together, to monitor it, to restart things when they fail. That's
where orchestrators come in.

So We've got a new breed of software, container orchestration, the most popular
one being Kubernetes.

Kubernetes : Kubernetes is the container orchestrator

Containers, Orchestrators and a service mesh gives you a powerful way to manage
and deploy your apps, especially in the cloud.
